<p class="backdropped">Main criminal restrictions (Wetboek van Strafrecht):</p>

<p class="backdropped">Group insult (Art. 137c): Public intentional insult of a group based on race, religion/belief, sexual orientation, or disability. Includes (since Oct 2024) insulting denial, condoning, or gross trivialisation of genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes (when judicially established). Max. 1 year (2 years if professional/habitual or joint).
Incitement to hatred/discrimination/violence (Art. 137d): Publicly inciting hatred, discrimination, or violence against persons or property on the same protected grounds. Max. 1–2 years.
Dissemination of prohibited material (Art. 137e): Publicly spreading statements known (or that should reasonably be known) to be insulting or inciting on protected grounds (outside factual reporting). Max. 6 months.
Defamation (smaad, Art. 261): Intentionally attacking someone’s honour/reputation by accusing them of a specific fact with intent to publicise. Max. 6 months (1 year if written/image).
Slander (laster, Art. 262): Defamation while knowing the accusation is false. Max. 2 years.
Simple insult (belediging, Art. 266): Intentional insult not amounting to smaad. Max. 3 months (higher when directed at certain public officials or members of the royal family in their capacity).
Incitement to crime / sedition (opruiing, Arts. 131–132): Publicly urging commission of a criminal offence or violent action against public authority.
Threats (Art. 285 and related provisions).</p>

<p class="backdropped">Other notes:</p>

<p class="backdropped">Specific lèse-majesté largely abolished (2020); royal insults now fall under ordinary insult rules with possible enhancement.
Glorification of terrorism / public support for terrorist organisations: bill submitted to Parliament (mid-2026); not yet in force.
Criticism of ideas, religions, or ideologies as such is generally more protected than attacks on groups of persons.
Civil liability (tort) and platform obligations (e.g. DSA) can apply independently.
Application is contextual; political debate and public-interest speech receive strong protection.
</p>

<p class="backdropped">This is a practical summary only, not legal advice. Verify current law and consult counsel for operational use.</p>
